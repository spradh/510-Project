Best Model
We conclude that MPG is best predicted by the simple linear model with explanatory variables Horsepower and Weight,i.e., model2HW. While Weight has always been found to be an accurate predictor of both the training set and test set, having a comparatively low residual standard error and high Adjusted R^2, we see that our model performs much better when weight is paired with horsepower with Residual Standard Error of 2.982 for DF=297 and Adjusted R^2=0.7781. Any other variable added to the model with Weight and Horsepower shows negligible improvements in terms Mean Squared Error of test data and Adjusted R^2 while managing to perform worse in terms of Residual Standard Error. Another reason we prefer model2HW is because the explanatory 
variables reject the null at very low significance levels: weight rejects the null close to 0% significance level, while Horsepower rejects the null at 0.1% significance level. There are models that rejects the null close to 0% significance level for all explanatory variables (such as modelD, modelH, modelW, modelA, model2DH, model2HA, and model3DHA) ; however none parallel the  performance of model2HW in terms of  the other indicators mentioned above. Although all the models have comparative low p-value of less than 2.2*10^(-16) showing that they are all significant, we believe that MPG is best predicted by model2HW.
